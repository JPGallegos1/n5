# N5 CHALLENGE

#### Get onboarding!

## Running the project locally

1. Clone the project `git clone git@github.com:JPGallegos1/n5.git`
2. Go to the folder where you've installed it `cd n5`
3. Install the dependencies `npm install`
4. Run the project locally `npm run dev`
5. Visit the project on `http://localhost:3000/` or `https://n5-smoky.vercel.app/`


The latest thing to add was unit tests but I didn't have much time to do great coverage. Sorry about that!
